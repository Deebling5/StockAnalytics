# Prediction on S&P 500
S&P 500 is a benchmark index in the United States and it is a significant stock market indicator to the US stock market. It is very worth to understand the trend and seasonality of the S&P 500, for stock and future index investing. In this part of the project, we are going to build a model to predict the S&P 500 in the future 12 months.

## Background on S&P 500
Coming Soon...

## Strategy
There are some ideas of how the model can be built:
<ul>
	<li>Model predict index purely on time-series statistical learning</li>
	<li>Model predict index by aggregating predicted stock price of index component companies, which are predicted purely on time-series statistical learning.</li>
	<li>Model predict index by different features on linear regression</li>
	<li>Model predict index by news sentiments</li>
</ul>

## Approach 1 - Times-series only Model
